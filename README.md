## About the Project

### Assumptions

- The base template for the frames assumes a light-skinned person (see https://github.com/highlight-run/party-parrot-as-a-service/blob/main/assets/frames/1.png). Next steps would be to sample the input image for the skin tone then pick a template that matches the tone.
